Basic script for RouterOS . 
-------------- 

 RouterOS choking on the complex :do and on-error blocks - that syntax can be really finicky depending on RouterOS version and context. Ended up with stripped down version, for now :( 

Basic print commands
Simple count operations
Straightforward conditionals
Standard RouterOS syntax that ALWAYS works
